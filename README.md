# Sites vulnerabilities and search vulns:

A collaborative list of great resources about RESTful API architecture, development, test, and performance. Feel free to contribute to this on-going list. [Awesome REST](https://github.com/marmelab/awesome-rest#public-rest-apis-to-use-in-tests)
 

Some of our tools can be accessed programatically using this API. The tools can be started, stopped and queried for output in a machine-friendly format (JSON). The following tools have support for API: Web Server Scan, Find Subdomains, Find Virtual Hosts, Network Scan OpenVAS, URL Fuzzer, SQLi Scan, XSS Scan, WordPress Scan, Drupal Scan.

Tools wise, SmartBear, the company that makes SoapUI, now has a security tool.

## REST API 101

REST - representational state transfer

Data usually is sent as JSON

HTTP methods have a meaning (usually):

     **GET** - List(collection), retrieve data (element)
    
     **PUT** - replace (all data is changed)
    
     **PACTH** update
    
     **POST** - create (new element)
     
     **DELETE**
